### Useful resources

- [w3schools - borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp) - This helped me for making borders around an element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools - margin](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp) - This is an amazing and structured article that gave me a detailed understanding on using margins. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
